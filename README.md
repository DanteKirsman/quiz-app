# Quiz App

Made this quiz app to practice React.js.

The quiz app is an interactive application that allows users to take quizzes on various topics from the [open trivia database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). Users can choose their difficulty, category and the amount of questions. The app has a user-friendly interface and provides results when the quiz is submitted. It is a fun way for users to test their knowledge and learn new things.
